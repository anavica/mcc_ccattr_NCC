Data and `R` code to support Vicedo-Cabrera *et al.*, (2021). The burden of heat-related mortality attributable to recent human-induced climate change. *Nature Clim Change* (DOI: 10.1038/s41558-021-01058-x).

This code has been implemented to reproduce the main analysis applied in the
study referenced above. It uses temperature-mortality data of 10 hypothetical
cities and the corresponding simulated temperature for 10 models defining the
two scenarios.

The analysis is divided in three stages: (1) 1st stage analysis (time-series
analysis), (2) Meta-regression (to extract the BLUPs and MMTs),
(3) Quantification of impacts under the two scenarios (factual / counterfactual)
